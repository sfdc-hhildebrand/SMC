    Provides the classes modeling a finite state machine. In SMC,
    a finite state machine consists of
  </p>
  <ol>
    <li>
      {@link net.sf.smc.model.SmcMap Map}s which consist of
    </li>
    <li>
      {@link net.sf.smc.model.SmcState State}s which consist of
    </li>
    <li>
      {@link net.sf.smc.model.SmcTransition Transition}s which
      consist of
    </li>
    <li>
      {@link net.sf.smc.model.SmcParameter Parameter}s and
      {@link net.sf.smc.model.SmcGuard Guard}s which consist of
    </li>
    <li>
      {@link net.sf.smc.model.SmcAction Action}s.
    </li>
  </ol>
  <p>
    The {@link net.sf.smc.model.SmcVisitor} abstract class
    implements the GoF Visitor pattern (p. 331). This pattern is
    used by the generator package to generate target language
    code from the FSM model.

    <a href="http://smc.sourceforge.net/SmcManSec6.htm">
      the programmers manual
    </a>
    for SMC's derivation from the Gof State pattern.
